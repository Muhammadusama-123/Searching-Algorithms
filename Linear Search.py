'''
In Computer Science, Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential 
search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that 
particular item and its position is returned, otherwise the search continues till the last item of the list.

# This algorithm is written with the help of a function and a for loop.

        print(f'Value found at {position + 1} position and the index of a value in a list is {position} '
              f'and the value which is searched in a list is {key}.')
